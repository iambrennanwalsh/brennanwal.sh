            If theres anything to know about me it&apos;s that I love what I do.
            I&apos;m so beyond passionate about technology, and the business
            world, that I don&apos;t even consider what I do work. It&apos;s a
            hobby. My passion. Its something I can do all day without developing
            the slightest burnout or fatigue.

            I preach the power of a positive mindset, gratitude, and the law of
            attraction. Life is so fragile and precious. So be happy for the
            sake of being happy. Like a child. Happy for no reason at all.
            Change your mindset, change your life.

            WagRegistry is a project in the works. It&apos;s a web application
            that aims to simplify the process of registering service, therapy,
            and emotional support dogs. It can be a confusing process and people
            often come to it with anxiety, worried about getting on their plane,
            an uber, or staying at a hotel with their dog. My app seeks to be
            simple but informative.
