<Box heading="How It's Done">
<Content heading="Introducing the PasswordHasher Component">

Utilizing the `UserPasswordHasher` from the new [Symfony PasswordHasher component](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-5-3-passwordhasher-component), we can easily hash our Users password.

Typically we hash user passwords at the initial persist, and when passwords are modified. So, assuming those requirements, an efficient way to put this new component to work is in combination with a Doctrine Entity Listener.

</Content>
<Content heading="The Steps">

Theres 4 steps involved. 1st we'll need to create the `UserListener` class. This will be a Doctrine Entity Listener that listens for the persist and update Doctrine events on the User entity.

2nd, we'll need to tell Doctrine about this Listener, by tagging the class with `doctrine.orm.entity_listener`.

3rd, we'll need to configure the PasswordHasher within our security config.

And finnaly, we'll hook our User entity up by pointing to the new listener as the argument to a `Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\UserListener` annotation.

Let me show you how its done and how to wire it up in your config.

<Box heading="Creating the Doctrine Entity Listener">
<Content>

Take a look at the `UserListener` class below. I inject an instance of the `UserPasswordHasherInterface` in the constructor which allows it to be used within the private `encodePassword()` method.

The real work though, happens in the `prePersist()` and `preUpdate()` methods. These methods are called automatically by Doctrine when a user is being persisted, and being updated.

That being said, users are often updated for reasons besides changing their password. So within the `preUpdate()` method we must check if the users password has changed. If it was, then we hash and change it. Otherwise we can just return.

```php
// src/Doctrine/UserListener.php

namespace App\Doctrine;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as Orm;
use Doctrine\ORM\Event\LifecycleEventArgs;
use Doctrine\ORM\Event\PreUpdateEventArgs;
use Symfony\Component\PasswordHasher\Hasher\UserPasswordHasherInterface;
use App\Entity\User;

class UserListener {

  /** @var UserPasswordHasherInterface */
  private $hasher;

  /**
   * @param UserPasswordHasherInterface $encoder
   */
  public function __construct(UserPasswordHasherInterface $hasher) {
    $this->hasher = $hasher;
  }

  /** @Orm\PrePersist */
  public function prePersist(User $user, LifecycleEventArgs $args) {
    $password = $user->getPassword();
    $password = $this->encodePassword($user, $password);
    $user->setPassword($password);
  }

  /** @Orm\PreUpdate */
  public function preUpdate(User $user, PreUpdateEventArgs $args) {
    if ($args->hasChangedField('password')) {
      $password = $args->getNewValue('password');
      $password = $this->encodePassword($user, $password);
      $user->setPassword($password);
    }
  }

  private function encodePassword(User $user, string $password) {
    return $this->hasher->hashPassword($user, $password);
  }
}
```

<Box heading="Tag the Entity Listener">
<Content>

Within your `/config/services.yaml` you'll need to tell doctrine about the Entity Listener we just created. You do so by tagging the class with `doctrine.orm.entity_listener`.

</Content>
<Content heading="Tagging an Individual Class vs. an Entire Directory">

You can choose to either tag just the individual class, or tag the entire directory. If you plan on creating additional Doctrine Entity Listeners (and you probably will), then I recommend the latter. Otherwise you'll need to add service configuration for each class. Besides Doctrine Entity Listeners are so useful, you're bound to create more of them.

```yaml
# config/services.yaml

services:
  # ...

  # Tag just the UserListener:

  App\Doctrine\UserListener:
    tags: ['doctrine.orm.entity_listener']

  # OR tag an entire directory:

  App\Doctrine\:
    resource: '../src/Doctrine/'
    tags: ['doctrine.orm.entity_listener']
```

</Content>
</Box>

<Box heading="Configure the Symfony PasswordHasher component">
<Content>

Next up we'll need to configure the PasswordHasher. So while you're still in your config directory, open up `/config/packages/security.yaml` and add the following snippet.

</Content>
<Content heading="A Note On the Encoders Key">

Symfony has depricated much of the old security system, including the old password encoders. If you've already configured an `encoders` key, simply replace it with the following `password_hashers` key which is [intended to replace it](https://symfony.com/doc/6.0/security.html#c-hashing-passwords).

```yaml
# config/packages/security.yaml

security:
  # ...

  password_hashers:
    # use your user class name here
    App\Entity\User:
      algorithm: auto
```

</Content>
</Box>

<Box heading="Tell Doctrine which Entity to Listen On.">
<Content>

You've created an Entity Listener, told Doctrine about it, and configured password hashing.

The final step is to tell Doctrine which Entity to associate with the listener. In otherwords, which Entity should it listen for events on.

```php
// src/Entity/User.php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as Orm;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface;
use App\Doctrine\UserListener;

/**
 * A user entity.
 *
 * @Orm\Entity()
 * @Orm\EntityListeners({UserListener::class})
 */
class User extends BaseEntity implements UserInterface {

  //..

}
```

</Content>
<Content heading="Give it a Try">

And thats that. Go ahead and try persisting a new user. When you look at the result the password should be an unrecognizable mess of characters. If so, great job! If not, you may have missed a step, or misconfigured a small detail.

If you'd like to learn more about Doctrine Entity Listeners, or the new Symfony PasswordHasher component, I encourage you to check out the following documentation.

<Content heading="The Interface of the PasswordHasherInterface">

Lastly, for reference, here is the interface of the `PasswordHasherInterface`.

```php
<?php

namespace Symfony\Component\PasswordHasher;

interface PasswordHasherInterface {

  public function hash(string $plainPassword): string;

  public function verify(string $hashedPassword, string $plainPassword): bool;

  public function needsRehash(string $hashedPassword): bool;

}
```
